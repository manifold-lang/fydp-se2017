\section{Conclusion}

We have made significant progress in turning Manifold into a powerful and usable toolchain for microfluidic device engineering.
We have expanded the syntax of the frontend language, added Modelica code generation to the microfluidics backend, and laid the framework for future advanced features such as automatic design refinement.

Due to Manifold's highly modular nature, new backend compilers can easily be created and inserted into the toolchain.
Manifold therefore has potential to be a toolchain not just for microfluidics, but for other engineering domains as well.
