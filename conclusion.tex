\section{Conclusion}

We have made significant progress with Manifold 2.0 in turning Manifold into a powerful and usable
toolchain for microfluidic device engineering. We have expanded the syntax of the frontend language,
added Modelica code generation to the microfluidics backend, and laid the framework for future
advanced features such as automated design refinement.

Due to Manifold's highly modular nature, new backend compilers can easily be created and substituted
into the toolchain we created. Manifold has potential to be a toolchain not just for microfluidics,
but for other engineering domains as well.
