We describe our work in creating version two of the Manifold systems design language and toolchain.
Manifold is a generic high-level system design language built to resemble modern functional
programming languages. It has been applied in the past to describe digital and microfluidic
circuits, with the most recent work focusing on microfluidics. The Manifold toolchain allows
engineers to describe their systems using simple and high-level abstractions with domain specific
libraries. The syntax of the frontend language has been expanded with several useful features,
including a type system, importable modules, and tuples. Manifold 2.0 supports Modelica code
generation to run time-domain simulations in the microfluidics backend. By integrating with tools
such as the dReal satisfiability solver, Manifold allows the design verification process to be
increasingly automated. We also demonstrate the process of synthesizing Manifold files into
schematics for simulation using MapleSim as well as additional tools in the future.
