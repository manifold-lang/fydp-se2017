Manifold is a generic high-level system design language designed to
resemble modern functional programming languages. 
%
It is intended to be usable in a variety of design domains that can be
conceptualized with components, connectors, ports, and constraints.
%
Domain-specific backends exist for microfluidic devices and digital
logic circuits.
%

In Manifold 2.0 we have enhanced both the frontend language and the
microfluidic backend.
%
The syntax of the frontend language has been expanded with several
useful features, including a type system, a module system, and
tuples as first-class values. 
%
The microfluidic backend has been extended to generate Modelica code,
which can be used to run time-domain simulations in third-party tools
such as MapleSim.
